						Languages and frameworks

					<ul class="ml-2 mb-2 space-y-2">
						<li>
							<strong>Svelte</strong>: I've been working with it for the past six or more months,
							and it served as my first introduction to the world of Javascript frameworks and
							libraries. Since then, I've tried other ones, but I keep returning to Svelte and
							Sveltekit.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Typescript</strong>: every project, whether it is a little project or
							libraries I always start with typescript; I don't have a lot of experience with
							javascript, but typescript is helping me understand it every day.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tailwind</strong>: Without a tailwindcss, I am completely unable to build
							anything, and it is very simple. Following the creation of any project, my first
							action is to install Tailwind.
						</li>

						Code Tools

					<ul class="ml-2 mb-2 space-y-2">
						<li>
							<strong>Vs code</strong>: My preferred code editor is vs Code, but I have also used
							and occasionally still use sublime.
							<ul class="ml-4 mb-2 space-y-2">
								<li>
									<strong>Theme</strong>: Github Dark
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Extensions</strong>: (some of my default everyday extensions) are:
									Background by shalldie (i like put anime background on vscode), Code Runner, Git
									History, GitHub Theme, Material Icon Theme, Live Server, Prettier, Svelte,
									Tailwind, Thunder Client.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Vercel</strong>: Nothing was lacking that I needed for me to use a different
							option.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Chrome</strong>: Because I use a Chromebook as my primary development tool, it
							comes pre-installed and is excellent. On my second, older Windows computer, I use
							Firefox and Edge. I don't even put Chrome on.

							through the screen. is not suitable for development purposes. it 4GB RAM and 32GB ROM.
							it is snappy and fast until sometimes when nodejs starts to node. the Linux virtual
